Collision 3D

Projects implements collision primitives and tests suitable for my MMO game.

Assumptions:
  - rotations are only around Y-axis

Implementing tests:
  - ray test
  - vertical cyllinder continous collision detection (simplified, sometimes
          treated as square base prism)
  - sphere continous collision detection (not implemented)

Collision Shapes:
  - vertical box
  - sphere (only ray tracing, no ccd tests)
  - vertical cyllinder
  - triangle ramp
  - rectangle ramp
  - height map
  - vertical capped cone
  - triangle vertical wall
